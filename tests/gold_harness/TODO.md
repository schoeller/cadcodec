# TODO.md — gold_harness open work

Revised 2026-10-03: finished items removed, the remainder written out
in plain language, and the maintainer's recorded scope decisions
(C1/C2/C3, all decided 2026-10-03) moved to their durable home in
`IMPLEMENTATION.md` §19.5. The full history of everything closed here
lives in `NEXT_SESSION.md` (the session addenda) and `IMPLEMENTATION.md`
(the chronological campaign record).

## Where things stand

The large measured campaigns are closed and hold their zeros: parser
parity, the strict loader probes, the ACS/SH solid-history work, and
the §20 genus gates (pending-zero under `--strict`; the cargo mirror
green — A7 closed, the pin regenerated to the grown specimen family).
The suite passes 1,633 tests with none failing (the three
`sh_brep_raw_tail` pins of the 2026-10-04 BREP packet, the three
`r13_14_header_raw_mirror` pins of the same day's header raw-mirror
packet, and the six `gh44_record_identity` pins of the same day's
gh44-error closure included), and
the generation identity is stable at
`f2187565…` over 25,728 bytes.

The corpus counts 694 files in five populations (the R13/R14 era
admitted 2026-10-03 when the parity campaign was accepted — the
decision record is `IMPLEMENTATION.md` §19.5 Tier 2). **The
established 401 libredwg-sourced population now measures ZERO fidelity
rows** (the eight pre-existing B1-era rows — five LIGHT and three
UNKNOWN_OBJ — fell 2026-10-03 with A5: the LIGHT CMC method
projection and gold's num_reactors availability check; see
NEXT_SESSION.md's session record). The twenty b6_routes fixtures
read 0/0. The 221 golden_entities fixtures carry three rows:
Leader_AC1014's single row plus the Region_AC1012 and Solid3d_AC1012
ACIS rows (item A9 below). The six brep mints carry thirteen rows in
one family — the BREP record's R2013+ trailing region (also A9). The
era population (the gold r14 dir, the two root examples, and the
41-file authored wave) measured its opening census at 103 rows:
example_r13 78, example_r14 20, the gold r14 Leader 4, and the
wave's Leader_r14 1 — while the other forty wave files and the gold
r14 Constraints/v read 0/0 (the era-census continuation's R13/R14
gates had already absorbed most of the previously recorded
89/153/149). The struct read key-gaps stand at 6 (the `class?`
desync-mirror family only — the 2026-10-04 R13/R14 header
raw-mirror packet collapsed the axis from 5,510). Both genus surfaces are green (the python
`--strict` gates pending-zero; the cargo mirror's pin regenerated
and reviewed 2026-10-03).

Items closed since the last revision, removed from the list below:
B3 (the R13/R14 specimen wave is fully authored — 41 files under
`fixtures/r13_r14/`, admitted to the corpus 2026-10-03 when the
parity campaign was accepted); B4 (the ACSH_BREP_CLASS "external-only" verdict was
falsified on 2026-10-03 — the class mints from scratch with
`SOLIDHIST=1`, and the dataset landed in `fixtures/brep/`); B5 (the
dead rows were recorded terminal on 2026-10-02 after all three lever
routes measured dead); B6 (every authoring route for subcurve kinds 19
and 27 was measured dead across the b6_routes specimens — the kinds
remain attested nowhere, and any future specimen rides the
capture+replay net automatically, so nothing is owed until one
surfaces); C4 (the golden-entities campaign landed on 2026-10-03 and
its original work surface was demolished by the era-census
continuation — the parity-campaign question it left open was accepted
the same day); A4 (the pre-R13
mirroring task — the maintainer decided 2026-10-03 to keep the
outright reject, so the task is dead until that decision reopens);
A5 (the eight pre-existing LIGHT/UNKNOWN_OBJ rows — closed 2026-10-03:
the LIGHT CMC method projection, gold's own normalize_value collapse
of the c3 method word, and gold's num_reactors availability check
mirrored in the reader with the zeroed-JSON form in the normalizer;
the established 401 population now measures zero fidelity rows);
A6 (the `--no-lz77` DataStore blocker — closed 2026-10-03: the
AcDs section registered in the AC21 writer's tables, hash 0 with the
name-keyed-map rationale, page size 0x7400 and encoding 4 from gold's
own decode comment; the arm completes on 2013+ authored files);
A7 (the genus cargo pin regeneration — closed 2026-10-03: the pin
regenerated and reviewed, the mirror green. The drift was the
fixture family's growth, not the 2026-09-30 writer session:
136→148 SAB carriers, 136→152 SH roots, 78→110 AcDs containers —
the 2026-10-02/03 drops joined the specimen lists with UNCHANGED
class widths (the elliptical quads measure the same cone/ellipse
forms), and the four recorded anomalies are the new SweepHelix
spline-surface SAB records the extractor's walker cannot fully
parse — an extraction-surface limitation honestly pinned as the
state, not a writer defect. The python gates stay pending-zero
with the TOLERATED occurrences grown 22→24 on the population);
A8 (the composite (47) subcurve — closed 2026-10-03: the
segment-list grammar named and typed. `BL num_segments`, then per
segment `BS kind` — kind 23: the absolute start 3BD + the
displacement 3BD; kind 11: the full arc form inline with the
R2013+ two-bit trailing tail (the same per-frame rule as the
standalone ARC region). The measured carriers all decode and close
exactly: the rectangle profiles (ExtrudePline/LoftMixed,
era-stable), the 3D profiles (Extrude3DPoly, true 3D deltas), the
mixed profile (RevolvePline — line, arc semicircle cap, line,
line). The reader's parser gates on the count, the known kinds,
the tail constant and exact closure — any deviation rides the
verbatim net; the writer emits typed; six carrier files
record-identical; three bit-exact test pins. The capture+replay
net's standing users are now the never-measured kinds only).

## A. Open tasks (agent code work)

### A9. The era-census residue

**The corpus-fidelity axis is CLOSED**: after the 2026-10-03
era packet (the R13/R14 parity campaign's opening surface —
example_r13 78→0, example_r14 20→0, the gold r14 Leader and the
wave's Leader_r14 0/0, the golden ACIS quads 0/0) and the
2026-10-04 BREP raw-remainder packet (the thirteen rows fell —
the ACSH_BREP_CLASS raw-remainder form mirrored, the tail
captured verbatim as the write authority, the BREP class
un-elided; the record-identity censuses on the conventional
rewrites: Brep_AC1027 153/153, Brep_AC1032 141/141, Brep_AC1021
206/206, Brep_AC1024 203/203), the 694-file
corpus reads **0/0 fidelity rows — the first fully-clean
corpus**. The record-identity censuses
(`analysis/record_size_census.py` against a
`DWG_NO_ECHO=1` rewrite — a separate axis) leave these surfaces,
ranked by size:

1. CLOSED 2026-10-04 — the struct-axis key gaps collapsed 5,510 → 6
   by the R13/R14 header raw-mirror packet: the era files'
   49/50-per-file HEADER key-shape class (the reader walked every
   R13/R14 wire slot but never populated the gold-JSON raw mirror
   for the era's variables — unknown_10, DIMSAV, BLIPMODE,
   ATTREQ/ATTDIA, WIREFRAME, DELOBJ, DRAGMODE, OSMODE, COORDS,
   PICKSTYLE, the R13/R14 DIM block, the DIMTXSTY handle, the
   DIMPOST/DIMAPOST/DIMBLK*_T quintet) and the SecondHeader
   junk_r14 family (gold's bit_check_CRC aligns to the byte
   boundary before the CRC read; silver read at the bit position,
   so the trailing junk word read shifted bytes on every mid-byte
   walk). The writer's four no-model slots (unknown_10, DIMSAV,
   WIREFRAME, DIMUNIT) now replay the captured wire value per the
   §19 H7 rule. The six remaining rows ARE item 3.
2. The SAT-era mints' SH-BREP records — Brep_AC1015's record
   carries a +4-bit modeled-field delta on the conventional
   rewrite (the record was ELIDED before the 2026-10-04 packet;
   the R2013+ mints are record-identical, the SAT-era ones still
   drift in the typed base/BD forms) and Brep_AC1014's 65
   divergent rows are the R13-era Tier-2 surface — both the
   era campaign's record-identity work, the same class as the
   example_r13/r14 conventional-rewrite census rows (all
   pre-existing, proven by the file-swap A/B at this packet's
   halt).
3. The `class?` desync-mirror rows — eight on entities-2d and seven
   on entities-3d (the B1-era mojibake family) — now the whole
   remaining struct axis (six rows at the report-total level); the
   2004-era tables' FileDepList-features rows share the same
   gold-side-walk-quirk class.
4. PolyLine2D's last two POLYLINE_2D crc rows.
5. Surface.dwg's six rows (the §18 surface family — the known large
   modeled-emission packet). CLOSED-SUBITEM: gh44-error's eighteen
   record-census rows fell at the 2026-10-04 gh44-error packet (the
   conventional rewrite now reads 11,073/11,073 record-identical):
   (a) the six LEADER handle-stream slack rows — her records park an
   unparsed bit-group between the walked main tail and the flag bit
   (2 zero bits on five, `0000100000` on 8774) nibble-aligning the RL;
   captured per record as `(walk_end, len, bits)` and replayed
   verbatim, with a MERGE-TIME GUARD (the writer's main end must
   equal the captured walk end — the first attempt regressed the
   INSERT 184D/MULTILEADER EAE8 whose readers under-read, their
   un-walked field bits entering the capture; the guard disarms them);
   (b) the five crc-only HATCH rows — the retained ACAD EED block
   moved to the tail (a remove-and-append reordering her
   [ACAD,16CA] wire to [16CA,ACAD]); the block now keeps its position
   (verbatim when it already encodes the model's pattern origin,
   re-encoded in place when a transform moved it — the H8h-ext-15
   keep-position rule applied to the hatch path); (c) the five
   type-57 rows — the BA quartet's LTYPE xref binding
   (`is_xref_resolved` 0→256 + the real block-header handle where the
   writer hardcoded 0+NULL; the LineType model gains `xref_handle`)
   and the 16A5 row (gold assigns text-dash strings SEQUENTIALLY from
   the strings area — the shapecode is the author's own value, not
   the offset; the reader walks sequentially and the wire shapecode
   replays verbatim via `dwg_shape_number`); (d) the two DIMASSOC
   rows — the intsectobj vector's ref code: gold's dwg2.spec
   declares 5, the authored wire carries 4 (the ref-code lesson);
   one-line SoftPointer. Six bit-exact pins in
   `tests/gh44_record_identity.rs`.

The standing era facts all hold and were re-verified on 2026-10-03:
gh209_1 166/166, gh109_1 664/664, HatchG 229/229, example_2000
750/750, example_2004 735/735, example_2010 536/536, example_2018
474/474, Constraints_2010 216/216, Constraints_2013 160/160.

## B. Fixture-needed tasks

None. The one question of this class — subcurve kinds 19 and 27 —
needs no fixture: every authoring route on this toolchain was
measured dead (the solid sweep and POLYSOLID emit no EdgeActionParam
records at all; the surface-mode sweep's path kind mirrors the path
entity's own curve kind; the sweep refuses infinite-line paths; the
constraint networks emit no edge params and refuse 3D curves), so no
AutoCAD or BricsCAD fixture can produce either kind. Both kinds stay
attested nowhere. If a real-world file carrying them ever surfaces
(from any source, any era), drop it into the fixtures tree with a
`.txt` provenance companion — the capture+replay net keeps it safe
from day one, and the typed-modeling packet opens then (the B2/A8
pattern). Until such a specimen appears, nothing is owed.

General fixture conventions, when new work does need one, are in
`fixtures/README.md`: fresh drawing, default template, one operation,
SAVEAS per target version, gold qualification with zero error lines,
and a `.txt` provenance companion.

## C. Standing guardrails (re-verified periodically; not tasks)

1. Full loader probes after any constructed-content change — README
   step 7b (`loaders/strict_load_probe.py`); the AutoCAD census is the
   acceptance signal.
2. Era censuses on the per-era constraints specimens after any
   writer-form change — `analysis/record_size_census.py` (the L4 gate
   in the zero-keeping workflow).
3. The generation identity canary after any writer change — `cargo
   run --example gen_all_entities_all_versions_dwg --features serde`
   plus `md5sum`; record the new value at the next halt (a tracked
   fact, not a frozen constant).
4. The genus pin refresh discipline — never hand-edit
   `config/genus_expectations.json`; regenerate with
   `genus/genus_extract.py` and review the drift (the `genus_gates`
   cargo mirror asserts fresh equals pin).
