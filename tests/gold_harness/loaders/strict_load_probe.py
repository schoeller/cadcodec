"""§20 strict_load_probe — the mechanized strict-loader audit (the eighth-layer instrument).

The §20.4 recorded procedure for strict-loader verdicts is the user-run
loader audit. This tool mechanizes the verifiable part of that
procedure: it drives the loader `/b <script>` (BricsCAD V26 by default,
AutoCAD 2027 — the format's author — alongside it; the DEFAULT run
exercises BOTH), and the script's LISP records the evidence a verdict
needs — the 3DSOLID/REGION/BODY aggregate (the modeler-forced
bounding box: a healthy restore yields real extents; a failed restore
yields the null-extents sentinel — ±1e80 under BricsCAD, ±1e20 under
AutoCAD), the widened per-kind census (CENSUS_KINDS — every entity
kind the canonical carries walks the trapped bbox force), the
DBMOD/ERRNO pre/post-audit record, and the post-audit census. The
campaign's acceptance — "clean open + clean audit, the solids
model" — is decided from those.

Validation (2026-09-30, the campaign CLOSED on both loaders — the
2026-09-29 null-box record below is the historical mid-state):
every constructed fixture + the full gen_all canonical + both
chimeras + all controls read MODELED with real extents and clean
audits under BricsCAD V26 AND AutoCAD 2027; the canonical's audit
reads TOTAL ERRORS 0 with dbmod 0 pre+post on both loaders (the
MLeader style repair + the MText attachment-repeat repair closed
the two loader-side every-open repairs). The widened per-kind
census (CENSUS_KINDS, 2026-09-30) walks all 29 kinds the canonical
carries — nothing is untested-by-divergence under either loader
(the XLine/Ray pair resolved as a non-defect by the
authored-control precedent: ACAD's type-filtered ssget never
returns construction lines, her own authored pair absent the same
way). The historical 2026-09-29 validation, kept as the record of
the mid-state: authored specimens 2007/2013/2018 all yielded real
extents (Box 0,0,0..1,2,3 across eras); the constructed corpus
yielded the null box at BOTH the current rank and the pre-rank code
— the constructed-SAB restore gap was pre-existing and
ordering-independent, and every historical loader reading was the
error surface, not the restored-solid census (see the G-B/G-A
records in IMPLEMENTATION.md §20.6).

The AUDIT-REPORT channels (2026-09-30, the maintainer's directive —
"ensure that you are receiving AUDIT reports"): the loaders' own
command-line logs are now harvested VERBATIM, per fixture per loader.
(1) The GUI LOGFILEON session log, BOTH loaders: the script wraps its
whole session — `_.LOGFILEON` before `_.OPEN` (so the open-time
restore diagnostics land too), `_.LOGFILEOFF` before QUIT — and
LOGSECs `(getvar "LOGFILENAME")` into the result file; the probe
copies that file to `{run}_audit.log` and unlinks the source (the
per-document log name is stable across runs of the same staged
fixture — AutoCAD derives it from the DWG name, BricsCAD from the
name + session timestamp — so without the unlink the next run's
report would append to the last one's) — and both GUI launchers
pin `-WorkingDirectory` to the staging dir so the per-document
log lands there (an unpinned launch inherits the WSL UNC working
directory and the harvest would miss it). VALIDATED LIVE (the
2026-09-30 channel experiments): AutoCAD 2027's log carries the
open banner ("Non Autodesk DWG …") + the full audit report
("Auditing Header/Tables/Entities Pass 1/Pass 2/Blocks/AcDsRecords
… Total errors found N fixed M … Erased K objects"); BricsCAD
V26's log carries the modeler's own words verbatim ("Name:
AcDbRegion(31) / Value: Modeling operation error: / Data stream
is empty / Validation: Invalid / Replaced by: Removed / 107
objects audited / Total errors found during audit 1, fixed 1").
The 2026-09-29 "LOGFILENAME unset, LOGFILEON produces no file"
finding was the V18-era/wxWidgets build — V26 (Qt) writes the
log; the sysvar stays read-only but the file it names is written
and readable, which is all the probe needs.
(2) The AutoCAD CORE CONSOLE (`--loader core`, accoreconsole.exe):
the headless core prints its ENTIRE command transcript — open
diagnostics, LISP echo, the audit report — to stdout, which the
launcher redirects to `{run}_core.log` (UTF-16 — read_log_text
decodes it); no dialogs exist to stall the run (the GUI /b flow's
known hazard), and the same census LISP runs there (the drawing
arrives via /i, so the script omits the OPEN stanza). ONE
measured limit (2026-09-30): the ActiveX bridge is DEAD in this
build's core console — vlax-ename->vla-object returns nil even
for entities entget reads cleanly — so the bbox modeler force is
unavailable there; the census logs `bbox-UNAVAILABLE (nil
ActiveX bridge)` and the verdict reads `AUDIT-REPORT` (the
modeler force stays the GUI channels' evidence; the transcript is
the core channel's). VALIDATED LIVE the same day.
CLOSED channels (tested, stay closed): stdout/stderr redirection
on bricscad.exe (both empty — GUI-subsystem app); WM_GETTEXT
(empty — the UI text is painted, not in window-text slots); UI
Automation (no Text/Value patterns, no accessibility bridge).
The window-lifecycle scraper stays staged as the DIALOG-APPEARANCE
evidence (which dialogs appeared, when — the modeling-failure
prompt is a top-level window), and the DBMOD/ERRNO record stays
as the audit-EFFECT evidence; the audit REPORT itself now comes
from the log channels above. The maintainer's hand-run
transcripts remain the highest-fidelity console evidence; the
probe's logs are the mechanized daily driver.

One staged-copy note: AutoCAD's `_.QUIT _N` answers "Really want
to discard all changes? <N>" with No — which KEEPS the changes,
so AutoCAD SAVES the staged copy on the way out (the `__acad.bak`
files are our own staged bytes; the core console prints "Drawing
saved in AutoCAD 2018 format" for the same reason). BricsCAD's
QUIT does not save. The staged copies are scratch — re-copied
from source at every launch — and every census section precedes
the quit, so no verdict reads post-save state.

The LOGSEC flush discipline (the evidence-survival rule): the
script's LISP writes EVERY result section through a `LOGSEC`
helper — `(defun LOGSEC (lines / f) (setq f (open RESULT "a"))
(foreach l lines (write-line l f)) (close f))` — so each section
opens the result file in APPEND mode, writes its lines, and closes
the handle: every line is on disk the moment it is written. The
earlier single-handle form (`(setq rf (open … "w"))` … one final
`(close rf)`) buffered everything in the handle and lost ALL
evidence whenever the run died before the close — which is
exactly what happens when a fixture trips BricsCAD's
modeling-failure prompt (the dialog blocks the /b script engine
mid-sequence) or the launcher's timeout kill lands: the staged
results read 0 bytes and the run looked AMBIGUOUS when it was in
fact a recorded verdict waiting to be flushed. With LOGSEC the
partial evidence survives any kill — a result that stops after
`open-entity-count` but never reaches `probe-end` is itself
evidence (the script stalled at or before the next section; the
verdict() classifier reads "AMBIGUOUS" for a missing probe-end
while the surviving lines still tell the census story). The tool
unlinks each result file before its launch so append mode never
accumulates across runs.

CLI: strict_load_probe.py [--probe-dir DIR] [--loader both|acad|bcad|core]
      [--bcad EXE] [--acad EXE] [--acore EXE] [--probe NAME:DWG]...
The DEFAULT run exercises BOTH GUI loaders (AutoCAD 2027 via
DEFAULT_ACAD and BricsCAD V26 via DEFAULT_BCAD): every fixture is
probed under each, with per-loader verdicts (the result files and
report rows carry a __acad/__bcad suffix). `--loader core` runs
the AutoCAD core console (accoreconsole.exe via DEFAULT_ACORE)
instead — the dialog-free transcript channel. Verdict vocabulary:
MODELED (real extents) / NULL-BOX (the null-extents sentinel —
±1e80 under BricsCAD, ±1e20 under AutoCAD; the B-rep did not
construct) / NO-SOLID / AMBIGUOUS. The targets default to the
constructed genus corpus (regenerate it first with genus_gates.py)
plus the authored specimen Box_2007 (the control).

Exit 0 prints the verdict table regardless; nonzero on launch failure.
