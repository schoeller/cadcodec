"""§20 genus_gates — the constructed-content oracle (the fifth layer).

The validation layer §20 designs and 2646f05 scopes: every existing gate
compares silver against GOLD on the same bytes, so constructed content —
documents silver authors from scratch — shipped real defects the corpus
could not see (the 2026-09-28 cylinder audit's factory
ACSH_HISTORY_CLASS and the SAB conic/quadric short-width desync both
passed 280/0/0 the same morning). This gate decodes the CONSTRUCTED
corpus silver-side, asserts it against the authored-specimen genus
(genus_expectations.json, extracted by genus_extract.py), and emits
ranked report sections:

  sab_form_diffs   G-A — the SAB form genus: per-class record widths
                   (width SETS — authored variance is legitimate), the
                   magic/version pair, the header triple, the product
                   strings, the tolerances, the terminator, the
                   record-class ordering, authored-uniform classes gone
                   missing, classes with no specimen coverage.
  sh_genus_diffs   G-B — the SH tree genus: for every history record in
                   a constructed decode, the topology invariants
                   (payload owner resolves to the graph, never the
                   solid; payload owner != ownerhandle; the 33/427
                   version pairs; history_node_id resolves to a written
                   node; the node's owner is the graph) and the scalar
                   root fields; plus the constructed-tree fixture's
                   observed state (the 2646f05 elide contract ranks as
                   the tree's current genus divergence).
  acds_genus_diffs G-C — the AcDs container genus: ds_version, the
                   segidx-first position, file_header_size, the
                   num_segidx scale, the populated-slot tail pattern,
                   the named-pointer slot types.

The gates land NONZERO on purpose (§20.3): the initial counts ARE the
work queue — G-C's container divergence ranks day one — and each row
closes through the §8.1.2 packet workflow with a strict-loader verdict
adjudicating (§20.4: the gates rank divergence; they do not decide
fatality). A row carrying a recorded verdict in ADJUDICATIONS closes
as TOLERATED: it KEEPS its count (the row is the recorded state) but
is annotated in the report and excluded from the pending_* counts —
the pending queue is the remaining work. The four fidelity axes and
the differ are untouched (§20.5).

The constructed corpus: the gen_all canonical (regenerated into the
workdir via the generator example; its md5 recorded as a fact, never
asserted — the generation identity is the separate canary) plus the
constructed-fixture family the codec emits (genus_constructed: one
solid per SAB surface family, one create_solid_history tree, one
region, one body).

CLI: genus_gates.py [--workdir DIR] [--expectations PATH] [--strict]
`--strict` asserts zero PENDING rows (adjudicated-TOLERATED rows stay
as the recorded state; for the day the queue closes). Exit 0 on
completion regardless of counts; nonzero only on pipeline failure.
