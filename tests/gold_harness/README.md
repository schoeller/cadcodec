# Gold-vs-Silver Roundtrip Harness

A repeatable test harness that closes the read/write fidelity gap between
**LibreDWG** (the *gold* oracle) and **cadcodec** (the *silver* implementation)
for DWG files. It decodes a DWG with both libraries, rewrites it with cadcodec,
decodes the rewrite again, and reports field-level differences in the
non-header object data. **Phase 2 (planned, §19 of
[`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION.md)): the header and remaining file
structure come under a second, separately-gated comparison axis with its own
drive to 0 and a whole-structure audit matrix; the OBJECTS 0/0 stays frozen.**

The full plan, architecture rationale, and the autonomous fix-loop
specification live in [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION.md). This README
is the practical entry point: install, run, interpret.

## Oracles — the four validation layers

| # | Oracle | What it catches | Needs the gold oracle? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deep unit gates — `cargo test --features serde` (all test-target segments green; roundtrip asserts `diffs <= max_known`) | model/retention regressions; a new raw-retention field without a `normalize_entity_for_comparison` arm trips the budget and the failing test names it | **no** — fully hermetic |
| 2 | Harness integration test — `cargo test --features gold-harness --test gold_roundtrip` | harness self-check + prohibited storage-only `EntityCommon` fields | **optional** — skips (with a notice written to `target/gold_harness_oracle_skipped.txt`) when `GOLD_DWGREAD`/`GOLD_TESTDATA` are absent; set `GOLD_HARNESS_REQUIRE=1` to make absence a hard failure (CI) |
| 3 | Full corpus — `run_corpus.py` → `report.json` + the residue dump (`pk18a_all_rows.py`) | non-header field divergences; read/write 0/0 is the OBJECTS-axis campaign target (`per_file` is truth; the by-type tables truncate); the planned structure axis (§19) adds separate counters | yes |
| 4 | Authored-wire byte-fidelity — byte-compare silver's *rewrite* of an authored file against the authored original, record by record | writer **form** defects both decoders tolerate (legal-but-different bitcode choices — a BS short form where the authored wire used the raw-16 form, BD shortforms vs raw doubles, alpha-method nibbles) that strict CAD consumers (BricsCAD, AutoCAD) reject | yes |

Layers 1–3 keep gold-vs-silver **parser parity** at 0/0. Layer 4 closes their
structural blind spot: the rt pair compares two lenient reads of the *same*
silver bytes, so it can never flag an encoding *form* — only byte-for-byte
comparison against the authored wire can. Full procedure and worked examples:
[`IMPLEMENTATION.md` §18](./IMPLEMENTATION.md).

### Oracle authority ranking

When signals disagree, the higher-ranked oracle wins:

1. **AutoCAD 2027 census** — per-kind real-extents bbox + audit totals; the
   format author's own modeler: **the acceptance signal** for constructed
   content.
2. **BricsCAD V26 census** — the same instrument on the second strict
   modeler; corroborates, governs only where AutoCAD evidence is N/A.
3. **accoreconsole** — the dialog-free audit transcript; hard-fail evidence
   (65010), no bbox force (nil ActiveX bridge).
4. **Genus gates (layer 5)** — the ranked divergence queue: an investigation
   aid; a row closes only on a recorded strict-loader verdict (§20.4).
5. **Wire identity (layer 4)** — record size+CRC against the authored bytes.
6. **Corpus parity (layer 3) + hermetic gates (layers 1–2)** — the
   regression floor, always green.

The ranking applies in two regimes: **regression floor (authored content)**
— the L1–L4 zeros never regress; census-blind defect classes live there.
**Acceptance apex (constructed content)** — the loader axis decides, ranked
as above; the genus gates rank the work toward it and decide nothing. The
ranking does not demote corpus parity: the census cannot see a field-level
parity diff or a record-form divergence on an authored file at all.

Layer 4's wire facts for record walking: the R2000+ object frame is
`[MS size][R2010+ UMC hdlsize][BOT type][window]` where the window starts at
the BOT byte; `bitsize = Size*8 − Hdlsize` is the handle-stream start, and
gold's `-v9` trace prints per-field `@byte.bit` positions in window
coordinates to walk against. Authors may also park an unparsed bit-group
BETWEEN the walked main tail and the frame's flag position (gold's trace
prints `handle stream: +N` — the gh44-error LEADER genus, 2026-10-04: five
records pad 2 zero bits, one parks `0000100000`; the reader captures
`(walk_end, len, bits)` per record and the writer replays it verbatim with a
merge-time guard — the writer's own main end must equal the captured walk
end, or the capture is inert) — and the trace's `+N` skip lines on MISSING
handle streams are gold's own decode-trace noise, not record content. Two harness instruments implement it:

- `dump_section_bytes` — record-framed raw byte dumps for the pair compare.
- `dump_proxy_graphics [--verify] FILE [HANDLE]` — derives + dumps the
  entity-common proxy-graphics metafile (the ODA "Proxy Entity Graphics"
  stream; format + type census in `acadrust::entities::proxy_graphics`), and
  with `--verify` asserts decode→encode byte-equality against the wire
  bytes.
- `ac21_token_diff [--section NAME] [--our-rt FILE] FILE` — the AC1021
  objects-layer differential (§19 H8c/H8d): extracts the author's on-disk
  compressed streams per page (RS de-interleave, factor 1, RS(255,251)),
  walks token sequences with a decoder-exact state machine (replay-validated
  per page against `decompress_ac21`), mirror-sims our rewrite's stream
  sliced at her window boundaries (the H8b gate rule per window:
  `page_size_if_rs_coded` vs her slot), maps both streams' anatomy, and —
  with `AC21_DIFF_RAW_DIR=dir` — dumps both reconstructed section streams
  for record pair byte-study.

The layer-4 campaign result it instrumented (closed 2026-09-21): silver's
rewrite of `2018/Leader.dwg` reproduces the LEADER and MULTILEADER records
byte-identical to the authored wire, and the strict-load target
(`gen_all_entities_all_versions.dwg`, 30 entities, the LEADER warn-class and
the MULTILEADER fatal-class both rooted through form mismatches both decoders
tolerate) opens in BricsCAD via plain `_open` with zero warnings.

## Origin quality of the gold specimens

The libredwg `test/test-data` corpus is **mixed-genus on purpose** — a
property to keep, not a defect to fix. Each R2004+ specimen self-identifies
in its `AcDb:SummaryInfo` ProductInformation string, and the census
(2026-09-22) splits it:

| corpus family | self-stamped writer | notes |
|---|---|---|
| named specimen set — `2018/Leader.dwg`, Line, circle, Point, Arc, Ellipse, Spline, Text, Polygon, Donut, Helix, Multiline, Polyline, PolyLine3D, RAY, ConstructionLine, Constraints, … | **ODA FileConverter**: `Teigha® CompanyName="Open Design Alliance" build 2.0 / registry 4.3, install "ODA"` | `2018/Leader.dwg`'s comments field literally reads *"This file was last saved by an Open Design Alliance (ODA) application or an ODA licensed application."* |
| the Leader drawing family's down-saves (`2007/`, `2010/`, `2013/Leader.dwg`) | **AutoCAD** `N.51.M.5 reg 21.0` (2017) / `O.48.M.294 reg 22.0` (2018) | one drawing exported across versions — carrying the SAME wire conventions as the ODA-converted 2018 variant |
| issue / real-world files — `gh44-error.dwg`, ATMOS-DC22S, gh109_1, `sample_2018`, `LiveSection1`, `example_*` | **AutoCAD**, various builds (C.608.0/17.2, M.x/20.1 2015-era, …) | different writer-generation conventions (e.g. 2015-era sequential LEADER tails vs the 2017/2018 underlap genus) |
| pre-R2004 specimens (`2000/`, `2004/` dirs) | no marker exists in the format | provenance decidable only structurally (byte-compare conventions) |

Two consequences for harness work:

1. **Wire conventions are content- and generation-class facts, not writer
   fingerprints.** The 17-bit MULTILEADER tail group and the LEADER underlap
   appear in AutoCAD-2017/2018-saved files and the ODA FileConverter output
   alike; the 9-bit group belongs to fresh simple-content mleaders from
   every writer. Attribute a byte by its specimen's stamp and content
   class, never by "the ODA file said so".
2. **The published ODA spec undersides the runtime by design**: every
   authored file — ODA-written or AutoCAD-written — carries wire details
   (hidden tail groups, the underlap layout, proxy-graphics metafiles) that
   the Open Design Specification does not document. Conformance to the
   spec's field model is necessary; the layer-4 byte oracle against the
   authored wire is the only sufficient check.

---

## What it does

For each DWG file the harness produces three diffs:

| Diff | Compares | Finds |
|---|---|---|
| **Read fidelity** (`*_diff_orig.json`) | gold's decode vs silver's decode of the original | fields cadcodec's *reader* drops or misparses |
| **Write fidelity** (`*_diff_rt.json`) | gold's decode of the original vs gold's decode of cadcodec's rewrite | fields cadcodec's *writer* omits or corrupts |
| **Internal consistency** (stubbed) | silver's decode of original vs rewrite | cadcodec read→write→read self-check |

Header data is **out of scope** (compared laxly); only the top-level `OBJECTS`
array (entities + non-entity objects) is diffed exactly.

---

## Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose | Provided via |
|---|---|---|
| Built LibreDWG `dwgread` | gold oracle (`-O JSON`) | `GOLD_DWGREAD` env var — **oracle-optional**: `cargo test` skips gold checks without it; fetch/build on demand with `bash tests/gold_harness/harness/bootstrap_oracle.sh` |
| LibreDWG `test/test-data` | DWG corpus | `GOLD_TESTDATA` env var |
| Rust toolchain (`cargo`) | builds silver binaries | system |
| Python 3.11+ (with `tomllib`; 3.8–3.10 need `tomli`) | normalizers + differ | system |

The harness itself (normalizers, differ, drivers, the two Rust binaries under
`src/bin/`) is self-contained in this directory. Nothing else in the repo is
required to run it, and the default `cargo test` suite stays hermetic (the
harness is behind the off-by-default `gold-harness` feature).

---

## Installation

These steps build the gold oracle and the silver binaries. They assume a
Linux/WSL environment with a standard build toolchain.

### 1. Build LibreDWG (gold oracle)

```bash
cd ~/work
git clone https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg.git
cd libredwg
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool texinfo perl python3 jq
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-bindings --disable-docs
make -j"$(nproc)"
# Smoke test:
programs/dwgread -O JSON test/test-data/2000/Line.dwg | jq .
```

`programs/dwgread` is the only artifact the harness needs. The corpus comes
with the clone under `test/test-data/`.

### 2. Point the harness at LibreDWG

```bash
export GOLD_DWGREAD="$HOME/work/libredwg/programs/dwgread"
export GOLD_TESTDATA="$HOME/work/libredwg/test/test-data"
```

### 3. Build the silver binaries

```bash
cd ~/work/cadcodec
cargo build --features serde --bins
```

This builds `dwg2json` (silver JSON dump) and `dwgrewrite` (read→write), both
registered as Cargo `[[bin]]` targets with sources in `src/bin/`.

### 4. Verify the environment

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/harness/check_env.py
```

It confirms `GOLD_DWGREAD` is executable and supports `-O JSON`, that
`GOLD_TESTDATA` has the `2000`…`2018` version folders, and that `cargo` is on
`PATH`.

---

## Running — manual

All commands assume the env vars from step 2 are set and you are in the
cadcodec repo root.

### Single file

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/harness/run_roundtrip.py \
    "$GOLD_TESTDATA/2000/Line.dwg"
```

Outputs land in `target/gold_harness/` (or a directory you pass as the second
argument): `*_gold_orig.json`, `*_silver_orig.json`, `*_rt.dwg`,
`*_gold_rt.json`, `*_silver_rt.json`, `*_diff_orig.json`, `*_diff_rt.json`,
and a human-readable `*_report.md`.

### Whole corpus (batch)

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/harness/run_corpus.py
```

Iterates the in-scope corpus (`test/test-data/{2000,2004,2007,2010,2013,2018}/*.dwg`,
the r13/r14 era dirs and root `example_r13`/`example_r14`, top-level
`example_*`/`sample_*`, and the harness `fixtures/` tree — the
§18.7 sh_history set, the golden-entities population, b6_routes,
the brep mints, the parked r13_r14 wave; **694 files** at this
halt) and writes an aggregated
`target/gold_harness_corpus/report.json` + `report.md` ranking divergent
`(entity_type, field)` pairs by frequency.

### Cargo integration test

```bash
cargo test --features gold-harness --test gold_roundtrip
```

Oracle-optional: shells out to the driver for a representative subset
(`2000/Line.dwg`, `2000/circle.dwg`) and asserts the harness runs cleanly and
that no prohibited `EntityCommon` storage-only fields appear in the diffs.
Without a LibreDWG checkout the test skip-passes and writes
`target/gold_harness_oracle_skipped.txt`; `GOLD_HARNESS_REQUIRE=1` turns
absence into a hard failure (CI), and
`bash tests/gold_harness/harness/bootstrap_oracle.sh` clones and builds the oracle
online when you want the real fidelity run.

**Strict mode** — assert zero `missing_in_silver` fields on the subset:

```bash
GOLD_HARNESS_STRICT=1 cargo test --features gold-harness --test gold_roundtrip
```

---

## The zero-keeping workflow — the regression gate for upstream changes

Both campaigns are closed at zero: gold-vs-silver **parser parity**
(read 0 / write 0 across all 694 corpus files — the 2026-10-04 BREP
raw-remainder packet closed the last rows, the first fully-clean
corpus; the structure key-gap axis sits at its recorded standing
total, 6 read / 0 write — the 2026-10-04 R13/R14 header raw-mirror
packet collapsed it from 5,510, leaving only the `class?`
desync-mirror family tracked in `TODO.md` A9) and the **strict-load
zero** (the generated 30-entity file opens in BricsCAD via plain
`_open` with no modal error and no warnings). Every upstream change
must keep both at zero. Run this gate, in order, before committing
any reader or writer change (all commands from the repo root with the
oracle env from [Installation](#installation) step 2 set):

### Step 0 — scope the change

| change class | gate required |
|---|---|
| docs / probes only | nothing (this file's sections) |
| reader / model fields | steps 1 – 3 |
| writer (bitcode emission, forms, streams) | steps 1 – 6 |
| entity construction / examples that emit DWG | steps 1, 2, 5 (+4 if the corpus inputs' rewrite bytes change output) |

### Step 1 — hermetic layer (no oracle needed)

```bash
cargo test --features serde
```

**Expected:** every segment `ok`, zero `FAILED`. This layer names its
own failure class: a new raw-retention field without a matching
`normalize_silver.py` arm trips the `diffs <= max_known` budgets and
the failing test prints the field. A deep-roundtrip asymmetry (a
written default the walk does not read back symmetrically) fails the
`dwg_roundtrip_deep_*` tests — the only sanctioned filter class is a
version-inherent diff (see the `dwg_raw_tail_bits` filter for the
canonical example).

### Step 2 — harness self-check (oracle-optional)

```bash
cargo test --features gold-harness --test gold_roundtrip
```

**Expected:** `ok` with the oracle present, or the skip-pass notice
`target/gold_harness_oracle_skipped.txt` without. CI sets
`GOLD_HARNESS_REQUIRE=1` to make oracle absence a hard failure;
`bash tests/gold_harness/harness/bootstrap_oracle.sh` brings the oracle online
on demand.

### Step 3 — touched-entity pair smoke

For every entity type your change touches, run the representative
authored file through the pair compare:

```bash
cargo build --features serde --bins
python3 tests/gold_harness/harness/run_roundtrip.py \
    "$GOLD_TESTDATA/2018/Leader.dwg"      # replace with your family's specimen
```

**Expected:** `..._diff_orig.json: 0` and `..._diff_rt.json: 0` —
gold-vs-silver on the original AND gold-vs-gold on the rewrite. Any
nonzero count means the change dropped or corrupted a field; read the
`missing_in_silver` / `wrong_value` / `extra_in_silver` rows in the
diff, fix version-gated, re-run.

### Step 4 — the full corpus (the parity zero)

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/harness/run_corpus.py
```

**Expected** in `target/gold_harness_corpus/report.md` (and
`report.json` — use the `per_file` totals there, never the truncating
by-type tables):

```
Files: 694
Read-fidelity diffs: 0
Write-fidelity diffs: 0
Structure read key-gaps: 6
Structure write key-gaps: 0
```

The fidelity zeros are strict (the 2026-10-04 BREP raw-remainder
packet closed the last 13 rows — the first fully-clean corpus);
the structure totals are the recorded standing state (the
R13/R14 header raw-mirror packet collapsed the axis from 5,510 to
6 the same day; the residue is the `class?` desync-mirror family
tracked in `TODO.md` A9) — they must not
move either. Also inspect one diff JSON for residues: any leftover
row class the
normalizers don't host (gold-only `unknown_bits` kept residuals are
the sanctioned exception class — see the comments in
`normalize_silver.py`).

### Step 5 — deterministic generation identity (writer/example output)

```bash
cargo run --example gen_all_entities_all_versions_dwg --features serde
md5sum gen_all_entities_all_versions.dwg
cargo run --example gen_all_entities_all_versions_dwg --features serde
md5sum gen_all_entities_all_versions.dwg
```

**Expected:** both runs identical (the current zero-file identity is
`07af0cc54ffc62ba428341617d7dc262`, 25761 bytes — the 2026-10-07
upstream merge's intended content changes: the constructed TESTBLOCK
block record now carries its INSERT in the insert list (upstream's
consistent block-record insert lists), the class registry's
`ACDBPOINTCLOUDDEF_EX` dxf-name and proxy-flag corrections, and the
viewport status fields; the app-info product strings stay acadrust —
the upstream crate-rename strings were reverted). Identical without
`--features serde`. The history: `0217fbac…`/24986 → `40ab5d35…`/25344
at the H5–H7 landing → `36279922…` at the MText repair →
`f2187565…` at the MLine-verts cache → `07af0cc5…` at the upstream
merge. LEADER 0x41 / MULTILEADER 0x51 — recompute and re-record the
identity here AND in `NEXT_SESSION.md` when an intended content
change moves it, never to paper over a regression). Spot-verify the mleader's metafile survives
the writer:

```bash
cargo run --bin dump_proxy_graphics -- --verify \
    gen_all_entities_all_versions.dwg 51
```

**Expected:** `verify: decode -> encode is byte-identical`.

### Step 6 — layer-4 byte oracle (writer form changes only)

Byte-compare silver's *rewrite* of the authored pair against the
authored original, record by record — the only instrument that catches
legal-but-different bitcode forms both decoders tolerate and strict
consumers reject:

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/harness/run_roundtrip.py \
    "$GOLD_TESTDATA/2018/Leader.dwg"          # rewrite lands in target/gold_harness/
target/debug/dump_section_bytes "$GOLD_TESTDATA/2018/Leader.dwg" 4907 256 > /tmp/a.txt
target/debug/dump_section_bytes target/gold_harness/*Leader_rt.dwg 1959 256 > /tmp/b.txt
# leader record: window [Address..Address+Size) = [4916..5156); MS at
# Address-3 (4913), UMC at Address-1 (4915); the rewrite's Address is in
# the trace frames — re-dump around (Address-9) for the current tree —
# then bit-compare both window byte-ranges.
```

**Expected** for the current tree: the LEADER record (240 / 0x6A)
and the MULTILEADER record (833 / 0x76) are byte-identical to the
authored wire, CRC included. Any divergence means the writer changed
a *form* — find the first divergent bit, walk it against gold's
`-v9` trace (frame facts in [Oracles](#oracles--the-four-validation-layers)),
and remember the golden rule: the harness layers 1–3 are form-blind, so
only this step protects the strict-load zero.

### Step 7 — the §20 genus gates (constructed content)

The fifth validation layer (IMPLEMENTATION.md §20): constructed
content — documents silver authors from scratch — has no gold
counterpart, so layers 1–4 cannot see it. The genus gates decode the
constructed corpus silver-side and assert it against the
authored-specimen genus:

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/genus/genus_extract.py   # regenerate + re-pin expectations
python3 tests/gold_harness/genus/genus_gates.py     # the ranked report
```

**Expected:** the pipeline completes and the report's three sections
(`sab_form_diffs`, `sh_genus_diffs`, `acds_genus_diffs`) are
well-formed. The counts are the **work queue** — they land NONZERO on
purpose (§20.3) and close row by row through the packet workflow with
strict-loader verdicts adjudicating (§20.4: the gates rank divergence,
they do not decide fatality). The four fidelity axes and the differ
are untouched (§20.5); the corpus report carries the sections as
ADITIONAL output. The cargo mirror
`cargo test --features gold-harness --test genus_gates` asserts a
fresh extraction equals the pinned `genus_expectations.json` — when
the decode changes, regenerate the pin and review the drift.

### Step 7b — the strict-load probe (the mechanized loader audit)

The §20.4 verdict instrument: `strict_load_probe.py` drives the
loader `/b <script>` over the constructed corpus plus the authored
specimen controls, and the script's LISP records the evidence a
verdict needs — the 3DSOLID/REGION/BODY aggregate (the
modeler-forced bounding box: real extents = a restored body; the
±1e80 sentinel = the null box), **the widened per-entity census
(2026-09-30): every entity kind the canonical carries walks the
trapped bbox force — `CENSUS_KINDS`, 26 kinds beyond the modeler
family — so each kind gains first-class loader evidence**, the
DBMOD/ERRNO pre/post-audit record, the post-audit census:

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/genus/genus_gates.py        # fresh constructed corpus first
python3 tests/gold_harness/loaders/strict_load_probe.py  # the verdict table
```

**The loaders under test (the maintainer's directives, 2026-09-29)**:
the default run exercises **BOTH** — every fixture is probed under
each loader with per-loader verdicts. **BricsCAD V26**
(`C:\Program Files\Bricsys\BricsCAD V26 en_US\bricscad.exe`) is the
current-generation modeler; the earlier V18 verdicts were measured
against a 2017-era restoration that rejects content V26 accepts
cleanly (V18 remains available via `--loader bcad --bcad <path>`).
**AutoCAD 2027** (`C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2027\acad.exe`,
the `DEFAULT_ACAD`) is the format's own author — the strongest
oracle. Its verdicts escalate the evidence: an explicit
**"Open Drawing - Errors found" dialog** (a file-level defect named
by the author's tool), an entity that aborts the LISP census loop
(an entget-level failure), or a clean open whose audit still purges
entities. NOTE the sentinel split: a failed restore reads ±1e80
under BricsCAD but **±1e20 under AutoCAD** — the classifier knows
both. CAVEATS: AutoCAD's dialogs stall /b scripts — kill a stalled
instance BY PID, never by name (`acad.exe` is shared with other
Autodesk sessions); an unhandled LISP error aborts to the script's
next line (a missing per-entity line is itself a verdict). Every
probe launch holds the window visible for 10 s (`_.DELAY 10000`
before QUIT — the /b lifecycle is otherwise a sub-20-second
flash).

**The LOGSEC flush discipline (the evidence-survival rule).** The
script's LISP writes every result section through a `LOGSEC` helper
that opens the result file in APPEND mode, writes its lines, and
CLOSES the handle — so each line is on disk the moment it is
written:

```lisp
(defun LOGSEC (lines / f)
  (setq f (open RESULT "a"))
  (foreach l lines (write-line l f))
  (close f))
```

A fixture that trips BricsCAD's modeling-failure prompt (the dialog
blocks the /b script engine mid-sequence) or a launcher timeout kill
still leaves its partial evidence on disk. The earlier
single-handle form (`(setq rf (open … "w"))` … one final
`(close rf)`) buffered everything in the handle and lost ALL evidence
when the run died before the close — the staged results read 0 bytes
and a recorded verdict looked AMBIGUOUS. With LOGSEC, a result that
stops before `probe-end` is itself evidence: the surviving lines tell
the census story and the classifier reads the truncation. The tool
unlinks each result file before its launch, so append mode never
accumulates across runs.

**The launch-time stall guards (2026-09-30, the ConstructedBox__acad
stall post-mortem).** The maintainer caught an AutoCAD /b run sitting
at the LISP prompt with the reader two parens deep, swallowing the
script's tail — the window hung until killed by hand. Root cause: a
one-paren-short else branch in the census LISP (two `while` forms
never closed; the reader then consumed `LOGFILEOFF`/`DELAY`/`QUIT`
as pending input). Both halves are now LAUNCH-TIME ASSERTIONS in
`probe_one`: `assert_lisp_balanced` verifies every generated `.scr`
parenthesizes to depth 0 (comments and strings tracked) before it
reaches a loader, and the `.scr` is written `encoding="ascii"` — a
non-ASCII byte (a UTF-8 em-dash reads as CP1252 `0x94`, a curly
double-quote) throws at the harness instead of reaching the
loader's ANSI codepage. An unbalanced template now fails the launch
with the defect named, never a stalled window.

**Expected:** **the AutoCAD 2027 census is the acceptance signal** — its
per-kind real-extents verdicts + audit totals decide, BricsCAD V26
corroborates (the [oracle authority ranking](#oracle-authority-ranking)).
The authored controls read MODELED (real extents —
e.g. Box_2007 `0,0,0..1,2,3`); a constructed fixture reads MODELED
when its restore gap closes, NULL-BOX (the ±1e80 sentinel; ±1e20 under
AutoCAD) while the
gap stands, NO-SOLID when the entity layer fails, AUDIT-REPORT for a
`--loader core` run (the core console's ActiveX bridge is nil — no
modeler force there; the transcript is the evidence), and AMBIGUOUS
(missing `probe-end`) when the run was cut short — the surviving
LOGSEC lines still rank the failure. A Windows-visible host and the
loader installs are required; stray loader processes poison
subsequent launches — kill them (by PID for `acad.exe`) before
re-running. **The current recorded verdicts** (2026-09-30, the
tenth-continuation state):
**the B-rep construction gap is CLOSED on both loaders** — every
constructed fixture reads MODELED with real extents and clean
audits under BricsCAD V26 AND AutoCAD 2027 (Region `0..10`, Box
`±5`³, the full gen_all canonical, all nine fixtures; the A-2
distinct-geometry probe reads every entity at its OWN SAB's
geometry; the chimeras construct in both directions on both
loaders), the widened per-kind census walks all 29 kinds (the
canonical's every kind has first-class bbox evidence), and the
canonical's audit reads TOTAL ERRORS 0 with dbmod 0 pre+post on
BOTH loaders. The root chain closed in five content packets: the
search her-grammar + the `_data_` row locators (the multi-record
mispair), the thumbnail row (the container at her complete
genus), the era-coded segmented End-of-* terminator (ACAD's
modeler rejected the old single-tag form with the 65010 Modeling
Operation Error at open-time regeneration — the accoreconsole
transcript named it; no RECOVER prompts remain), the MLeader
style repair (the bcad-side "LeaderStyle Id is Null / 3 fixed"),
and the MText attachment-repeat repair (the acad-side
"AcDbMText was repaired / 2 fixed" — the R2018+ redundant block
repeats the absolute attachment point; a zero there is a corrupt
repetition).

**AUDIT reports — the loaders' own logs, harvested verbatim
(2026-09-30, the maintainer's directive).** The 2026-09-29 "no log
channel" finding was the V18-era/wxWidgets build: the CURRENT
loaders write their command-line logs and the probe harvests them
per fixture per loader. The script wraps its whole session in
`_.LOGFILEON` … `_.LOGFILEOFF` (so the open-time restore
diagnostics land too), LOGSECs `(getvar "LOGFILENAME")` into the
result file, and the probe copies that file to `{run}_audit.log`
(unlinking the source so the next run of the same staged fixture
never appends to it) and prints an "audit report (verbatim)"
digest. Validated live: AutoCAD 2027's log carries the open banner
+ the full audit ("Auditing Header/…/AcDsRecords … Total errors
found N fixed M … Erased K objects"); BricsCAD V26's log carries
the modeler's own words ("Name: AcDbRegion(31) / Value: Modeling
operation error: / Data stream is empty / Validation: Invalid /
Replaced by: Removed / N objects audited / Total errors found
during audit 1, fixed 1"). `--loader core` adds the AutoCAD core
console (`accoreconsole.exe`): headless, dialog-free, its entire
transcript (open diagnostics + LISP echo + the audit) redirected to
`{run}_core.log` (UTF-16 — decoded); ONE measured limit:
`vlax-ename->vla-object` returns nil in that core build, so the
bbox modeler force is unavailable there — the census logs
`bbox-UNAVAILABLE (nil ActiveX bridge)` and the verdict reads
`AUDIT-REPORT` (the modeler force stays the GUI channels').

**Console capture — the window-lifecycle scraper (the dialog
channel; its tested limits).** `WM_GETTEXT` returns empty on these
UIs (the text is painted, not stored in window-text slots), and UI
Automation exposes no Text/Value patterns (no accessibility
bridge); a stdout redirect on `bricscad.exe` is likewise empty
(tested 2026-09-30). What works is `GetWindowText` for window
TITLES — so the probe ships `bricscad_console_scraper.ps1`: the
launcher spawns it with the loader PID and it polls every 250 ms,
logging each top-level window's class + title at first appearance
with timestamps into `<name>_console.log`. The transcript captures
WHICH dialogs appear during a run (the modeling-failure dialog is a
top-level window), WHEN, and their titles — alongside the
LOGSEC LISP census, the DBMOD/ERRNO record, and the harvested audit
log, that is the complete programmatic evidence surface on these
builds. The probe's analyzer digests the transcript against the
strict loader's message vocabulary (deduped, with repetition
counts). A hand-run transcript from the maintainer remains the
highest-fidelity console evidence.

### When a layer trips

- **Step 1 fails** — model/normalizer/budget mismatch: the failing
  test names the field; fix version-gated (never widen the budget to
  silence it).
- **Steps 3–4 fail** — parser parity regression: run the per-file
  diff, read the offending `(entity_type, field)` rows, fix
  version-gated against the gold spec (`libredwg src/dwg.spec /
  dwg2.spec`). The convergence recipe — context budgeting, per-field
  decision tree, blocked-handling — lives in
  [`IMPLEMENTATION.md` §8.1](./IMPLEMENTATION.md#81-subagent-execution-guide-128k-context).
- **Step 5 md5 drifts without an intended change** — nondeterminism
  (a hash-ordered collection in a writer path: the
  `Mesh::compute_edges` BTreeSet fix is the canonical example).
- **Step 6 diverges** — encoding-form regression: re-derive the
  authored convention from the census (attribute by specimen origin
  stamp + content class, per [Origin quality](#origin-quality-of-the-gold-specimens)),
  keep the value-preserving guards, and re-verify the affected
  strict-consumer behavior.
- **Step 7's mirror fails on the pin compare** — the decode changed
  the projections: regenerate `genus_expectations.json` with
  `genus_extract.py` and review the drift (expectation drift is itself
  reviewable, §20.3); never hand-edit the pin.
- **Step 7b reads NULL-BOX / NO-SOLID / a dialog stall** — a
  strict-loader defect: read the surviving LOGSEC lines and the
  window transcript first (the census story ranks the failure);
  then bisect with the chimera/subset instruments (`sab_swap`,
  `fresh_pair`, `entity_subset`) and the record-identity census:
  `python3 tests/gold_harness/analysis/record_size_census.py ORIG.dwg
  REWRITE.dwg` (gold `-v9` object blocks, handle-keyed, per-record
  identity = size + hdlsize + bitsize + CRC-16; the R2018 + every
  era the AC1021 survey never covered; `DWG_NO_ECHO=1
  target/debug/dwgrewrite F conv.dwg` produces the conventional-arm
  rewrite to census against). Kill a
  stalled loader BY PID (`acad.exe` is shared with other Autodesk
  sessions).

### Hard rules (inherited, unchanged)

- Never edit LibreDWG — it is a read-only oracle.
- Never edit `ignore_fields.toml` or `diff_fields.py` to make a diff pass.
- Never touch version dispatch, decompression, CRC, or the section map.
- Gate every fix behind the exact version predicate gold uses.
- Each checkpoint must leave the build green.
- Header comparison stays lax.

## The entity-behavior verification matrix

`entity_verification.py` verifies EVERY supported entity kind on five
axes, all measured on the gen_all canonical (the single AC1032
document carrying all ~29 kinds):

- **BUILD** — the public API's add_entity verdict (all 29 OK, 0 SKIP)
- **SILVER-READ** — our decode of the generated file (39 entities,
  all kinds present)
- **GOLD-READ** — libredwg's census (54 entities — the block
  entities from the INSERT census too; 0 ERROR lines — the MLine
  verts defect closed at the 2026-09-30 segment-parameter-cache
  packet: the model now computes the per-element miter-trim cache
  every authored specimen carries)
- **REWRITE** — the conventional-arm read→write→read survival
  (every kind: n/n)
- **MODELER** — the strict-loader probe (every fixture + the full
  canonical read MODELED with real extents and clean audits under
  BOTH loaders — BricsCAD V26 and AutoCAD 2027; the canonical's
  audit reads TOTAL ERRORS 0 with dbmod 0 pre+post on both; the
  widened per-kind census walks all 29 kinds — nothing is
  untested-by-divergence under either loader, the XLine/Ray pair
  resolved as a non-defect by the authored-control precedent)

```bash
python3 tests/gold_harness/loaders/entity_verification.py [--no-probe]
```

### The 29-kind status snapshot (recorded 2026-09-30, both loaders)

The same matrix, flattened to per-kind status. Build / Silver-read /
Gold-read / Rewrite are the measured counts on the canonical (Build `OK` =
the public API accepts the kind; `OK*` = constructed via the typed sibling
constructor — the example's build list names the exact add_entity verdicts);
AutoCAD census / BricsCAD census are the per-entity bbox-force verdicts
(AutoCAD first, per the
[oracle authority ranking](#oracle-authority-ranking)).

| Entity | Build | Silver-read | Gold-read | Rewrite | AutoCAD census | BricsCAD census |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Point | OK | 1 | 1 | 1/1 | real extents | real extents |

| Mesh | OK | 1 | 1 | 1/1 | real extents | real extents |

| Body | OK | 1 | 1 | 1/1 | real extents | real extents |

¹ AutoCAD's type-filtered `ssget` does not return construction lines at all
— the authored controls' own XLine/Ray records are absent the same way
(resolved non-defect, the eleventh-addendum record); the ±1e20/±1e80
sentinel box IS a construction line's healthy bounding box.
² Gold censuses polyline-family vertices as separate typed entities
(display-label overlap; the counts are right per the standing residue note
below).
³ AutoCAD's ActiveX bbox force refuses viewport extents — the authored
controls' viewports show the identical trait (not a writer defect).
⁴ Gold decodes the constructed 3DFACE as its raw carrier (the cosmetic
name-map gap; silver-side and both modelers see it typed).

Audit totals on the canonical: **AutoCAD 2027 — Total errors 0, dbmod 0
pre+post; BricsCAD V26 — 159 objects audited, Total errors 0 fixed 0.**
Regenerate with the command above; the probe axis requires the Windows host
with both loaders installed.

The report lands at `target/entity_verification/report.md` with the
per-kind matrix and the evidence. The standing residue: the
harness's cosmetic name maps (gold names like 3DFACE/POLYLINE
overlap — the counts are right, the display labels don't always
match). The search-segment format defect, THE B-REP CONSTRUCTION
GAP, and THE MLINE VERTS DEFECT are ALL CLOSED (the 2026-09-30
sixth/seventh/twelfth-continuation packets — the search rewritten
to her grammar plus the `_data_` row-locator root, the
multi-record distinct-geometry probe reading every entity at its
OWN SAB's geometry; the thumbnail row + the era-coded segmented
End-of-* terminator closing the construction gap on BOTH loaders;
and the MLine segment-parameter cache — the model computes the
per-element miter-trim values every authored specimen carries,
gold's standing ERROR gone and the entity reading real extents on
both loaders — every fixture MODELED under BricsCAD V26 AND
AutoCAD 2027 with clean audits).

## File inventory

Every tracked file in this directory, plus the adjacent tracked scripts the
harness relies on. The harness bins below are registered in the root
`Cargo.toml` as `[[bin]]` targets (`dwg2json` with `required-features =
["serde"]`; the rest unconditional); the `entity_atlas` example is gated
there with `required-features = ["serde"]` alongside them.

| Path | Role |

| `src/bin/dump_proxy_graphics.rs` | Proxy-graphics metafile derivation + `--verify` byte-roundtrip proof |
| `src/bin/genus_constructed.rs` | The §20 constructed-fixture family generator (one solid per SAB surface family, one region, one body, one `create_solid_history` tree) |
| `genus/genus_extract.py` | The §20 expectation extractor — decodes the specimen family silver-side, projects the SAB/SH/AcDs genus into the pinned expectations |
| `config/genus_expectations.json` | The pinned genus expectations (regenerate with `genus_extract.py`; the cargo mirror diffs a fresh extraction against this copy) |
| `genus/genus_gates.py` | The §20 gate run — decodes the constructed corpus, asserts against the pin, emits the ranked `sab_form_diffs` / `sh_genus_diffs` / `acds_genus_diffs` sections |
| `loaders/entity_verification.py` | The entity-behavior verification matrix — builds the gen_all canonical (every supported kind), reads it back with silver + gold, rewrites it (the conventional arm), and probes it under both strict loaders (AutoCAD census first); the five-axis report lands at `target/entity_verification/report.md` |
| `loaders/strict_load_probe.py` | The §20.4 strict-loader verdict instrument — drives the loader `/b` script (the LOGSEC LISP census + DBMOD capture + the 10 s visible hold) over the constructed corpus and the authored controls; the default run exercises BOTH GUI loaders (AutoCAD 2027 via `DEFAULT_ACAD` first, BricsCAD V26 via `DEFAULT_BCAD`, per-loader verdicts); `--loader acad/bcad/core` narrows (`core` = the AutoCAD core console, accoreconsole.exe via `--acore` — the dialog-free transcript channel); `--bcad`/`--acad`/`--acore` override the paths; each GUI run harvests the loader's LOGFILEON session log to `{run}_audit.log` and prints the verbatim AUDIT report (the modeler's own words "Data stream is empty", the audit totals), alongside the census/bbox/DBMOD evidence and the window-title scraper transcript |
| `analysis/record_size_census.py` | The record-identity census for ANY pair on ANY era — gold `-v9` object blocks, handle-keyed, per-record identity = size + hdlsize + bitsize + CRC-16 (the R2018-record battery's instrument, 2026-09-29; the era-census + rewrite-acceptance acceptance gate; `DWG_NO_ECHO=1 target/debug/dwgrewrite` stages the conventional-arm rewrite) |

| `examples/sab_swap.rs` | The payload-swap chimera generator (authored wrapper + constructed SAB and vice versa, plus the pure-rewrite control) — the file-level rejection bisect instrument |
| `examples/fresh_pair.rs` | The fresh-vs-read document pair generator (the same entity through the two write paths) |
| `examples/line_only.rs` | The minimal innocent-file control (a fresh doc with only a LINE) |
| `examples/entity_subset.rs` | The entity-subset rewrite generator (`first N` / `3d` / `drop3d`) — the second-poison bisect instrument |

**Adjacent tracked scripts the harness does not own** — documented for
completeness:

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| root `Cargo.toml` | Workspace manifest; registers the harness bins and the feature-gated `entity_atlas` example (`[[bin]]` / `[[example]]` blocks) |
| `tests/roundtrip.rs`, `tests/gold_roundtrip.rs`, `tests/genus_gates.rs` | The Rust test surfaces the workflow's steps 1–2 and 7 gate on (the harness integration tests are feature-gated `gold-harness`) |
| `tests/issue64/validate_ezdxf.py` | Issue-64 DXF validation helper (fixture pair for `issue64.rs`; not part of the gold-vs-silver harness) |

---

## Output interpretation

- `missing_in_silver` — gold has a field silver lacks (reader gap or
  projection gap).
- `wrong_value` — both have the field but values differ (check bitcode type
  and version gating against the gold spec).
- `extra_in_silver` — silver emits a field gold doesn't have for this version
  (usually a dump/normalizer version-gating issue).
- `count_mismatch` — gold and silver decoded different numbers of a type
  (coverage gap, e.g. proxy/unknown objects).

Handles are compared by **resolved target type**, not raw id, because handles
are reassigned on rewrite. Records are aligned by `(type, ordinal-within-type)`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `GOLD_DWGREAD is not set` | env var missing | re-export per Installation step 2 |
| `dwgread` non-zero exit on a file | gold can't decode it (advanced R2010+ object) | treated as "skip file", not a silver failure |
| harness diff count jumps after an edit | cross-version regression | re-run all 6 versions; the version gating is wrong |
| `cargo test` fails with harness off | unrelated to harness | harness is feature-gated; check the core change |
